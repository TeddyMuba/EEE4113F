## Red-winged-Starling-Monitoring-project

## Problem Statement
Sally, a field technician from the Fitzpatrick Institute, is working on the Red-winged Starling 
Project at the University of Cape Town Upper Campus. She needs a way to monitor the bird's nests to
gain insights into how the busy campus environment affects their breeding success. This is because 
she noticed that some nests were destroyed, and the chicks were often found dead or missing.
